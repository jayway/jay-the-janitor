# Jay the Janitor

This repo contains scripts used at some point for janitorial tasks at Jayway.

## Access tokens

Most of the scripts require some kind of authorization to run. Look at the
individual scripts for details; most of them will be expected to be in files
named `<something>-token.*`. You'll have to create your own tokens for the
various services in order to run the scripts.
